# MITutor3.0

The new release allows users registered as instructors to create problems (MICreator) and monitor student performance (MIDash) or students to solve problems (MITutor). A proxy server is used to query the API to code for motivational interviewing skills. 

This version registers all users as Fall 2019 Test User with role assigned of instructor. The problem and log data is not stored in a database. Any new problems or log data will be stored for a session only, and is erased once the browser refreshes the page.
